I built this website because I missed one. I used Hugo as you can see from footer, and I used this amazing theme by [panr](https://twitter.com/panr). I kept the image of the first post because it was amazing inside the theme. This theme is a good representation of myself, I use this style in my text editors, my OS.. but I'm not like Mr. Robot, though I love the character. I don't think I'm going to make a series of blog posts, maybe in the future.  
I don't know why you're reading this page, but probably you can find the info you need in About and Contact pages.
